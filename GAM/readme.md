# Assignment carried out during the semester of automatic generation of music

For this project, I wanted to generate music from played video in which the music is generated according to the video's information like RGB values of each frame

## How to use:

* Insert indicated values of the comments in the number boxes
* Choose Video.
* Set toggle connected to [auto $1] as ON.
* Activate metronome

### Note
I used VirtualMIDISynth as the synthetizer and GEM library to read the video.

On PD, set the GEM library on startup
